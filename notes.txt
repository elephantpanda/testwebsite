All systems of inequalities in the reals can be reduced to:



Exists(x in R^d |   A[n,m,o,p]x[n]x[m]x[o]x[p] = 0 , X[n]x[n] = 1 )

equivalently
Exists(x in PR^(d-1) | A[n,m,o,p]x[n]x[m]x[o]x[p] = 0  )

equivalently
  
And(i=0..L)  B[i][n][m]x[n][m]=0  ,delta(n,m) X[n]x[m] = 1

So           (B[i][n][m]+delta(n,m))x[n]x[m] = 1  

 B'[0][n][m]=delta(n,m)
 B[i] = B[i]-B[0]

equivalently(?)
B[i][n][m]x[n][m]=1?
