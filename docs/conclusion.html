<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Dependently typed language would be quite useful for things like neural network models.

<br>
Type inference would be quite important as you can spend a lot of time writing types.
<br>
Currently f(x) is implemented as a tree like APPLY(f,x) which is probably not the most efficient. It might be better to have the x attached to f as the head node.
<br>
Simplification levels are important. 
<br>
Basing the data structure on lists would be better. Perhaps also things like S(S(S(S(x)))) might be simplified using a list data structure.
