<h1>Topology</h1>
There are various ways to build a topological space: As a subset of some bigger space; as the union of other spaces (glueing together boundaries); as the product of lower dimensinoal spaces; as the quotient of two spaces. We then want to determine when different constructions are essentially the same (i.e. can be smoothly transformed into each other).

<h2>Spheres</h2>
The 3-spheres can be defined as the set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^3 \) subject to a restriction.

<script>
    createInput(`
circle = Var("\\\\mathbb{S}_2",Type);
circle.mk = Var("S_2.mk", FORALL(Real, x=> FORALL(Real,y=> Real.equals( Real.plus(power(Real,x,2) ,power(Real,y,2)), Real.one).to(circle)   )  ));
circle.mk(Real.fromRat(3/5),Real.fromRat(4/5))
    `)
</script>
In other words the definition is a set of real numbers, together with the proof that these numbers satisify the equation of a sphere.<br>
The 1-sphere (circle) can also be defined by \( S_1 = \{x,y \in \mathbb{R}| x + 1 \sim  y \} \) or, equivalently, \(S_1 = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \)

<h2>Subsets</h2>
We can use the conditional construct to form subsets:
<script>
    createInput(`
isEqual2 = FUN(Nat,x=>Nat.equals(x,2))
isTwoType =conditional(Nat)(isEqual2);
isTwoType.mk = conditional.mk(Nat)(isEqual2);
isTwoType.mk(2)(rfl(Nat)(2));
    `)
</script>
<br>
So for a circle this is:
We can use the conditional construct to form subsets:
<script>
    createInput(`
isOnCircle = FUN(Complex(Real), z=>Real.equals( Real.plus(power(Real,realPart(Real,z),2) ,power(Real,imPart(Real,z),2)), Real.one));
S2   =  conditional(Complex(Real),isOnCircle );
S2.mk = conditional.mk(Complex(Real),isOnCircle);
S2.mk( Complex.mk(Real)(3/5,4/5) )
    `)
</script>

<h2>Homeomorphism and Isomorphisms</h2>
Homeomophism and isomorphisms. Consider a torus embedded in 4-dimensions. It can be parameterised by \(\theta\) and \(\phi\).

<h2>Poincar√© Conjecture</h2>
This relates to showing that a simply closed 3-manifold with trivial group is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. (Homeomorphic is Greek for `same-shape') It is solved and proved to be true <br>

<h2>Hodge Conjecture</h2>
More-or-less this states that certain aspects of the topology of a manifold defined by an algebraic equation in complex (projective) space can be defined in terms of other algebraic sub-manifolds. 

<h2>CW-Complexes and Simplex Complexes</h2>
We could specify a topology by a list of vertices, edges, faces and so on.
