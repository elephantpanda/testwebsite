<h1>Calabi Yau Manifold</h1>
A Calabi Yau Manifold is a Complex surface on which we can assign a Ricci-flat (Kahler) metric. This has been shown to be equivalent to it having \(SU(n)\) holonomy (this describes the way arrows are transformed when moved in a loop). All smooth algebraic varieties in \( \mathbb{CP}^n\) are Kahler manifolds.

<h2>Compact dimensions</h2>

We shall give some examples of Calabi Yau manifolds. One of the the most symmetrical is:

$$ \{(v,w,x,y,z)\in \mathbb{CP}^4 | v^5+w^5+w^5+x^5+y^5+z^5 = 0  \}$$

(This is equivlanet to the surface )
<br>
Mistake here as indices for CP4 are 0..4 
<script>
    createInput(
`conditional(Proj(CR,4))(FUN(Proj(CR,4),x=>equals(CR,
   sum(CR, FUN(Nat, n=>power(CR,Proj.get(CR,4,x,Zmod.fromNat(4,n)),5)) ,4)
, Complex.mk(Real,0,0)  )))

`.replaceAll("\\","\\\\"))
</script>
A member of this type therefore includes a member of \( \mathbb{CP}^4 \) together with a proof that it satisfies the equation.

<h2>Projective Space</h2>
A projective space over field \(F\) is defined by:

$$ F\mathbb{P}^{n} \cong  F^{n+1}\backslash \{0\} / \{ \forall_{\alpha\in F}(x_1,..x_{n+1}) \sim  (\alpha y_1,..,\alpha y_{n+1})   \}  $$ 
<br>(Not sure how to do equivalence relations yet)<br>
<h2>Isomorphisms</h2>
Some isomorphisms between different types (topological spaces) are:<br>


<script>
    createInput(
`Iso(Proj(R,1),sphere(1));
Iso(Proj(R,3),SO(4));
Iso(Proj(CR,1),sphere(2));
Iso(Proj(HR,1),sphere(4));
Iso(Proj(OcR,1),sphere(8))
`)
</script>
Also:
$$\mathbb{ZP}^1\backslash\{(1,0)\} \cong \mathbb{QP}^1\backslash\{(1,0)\} \cong \mathbb{Q}$$

<h2>Homeomorphism</h2>
The definition of homeomorphism could be something like:

$$A\cong B \rightarrow \exists_{\phi:A\rightarrow B, \psi:B\rightarrow A} (\forall_{y:B}\exists_{x:A}\phi(x)=y \wedge \psi(\phi(x))=x ) \wedge (\forall_{y:A}\exists_{x:B}\psi(x)=y \wedge \phi(\psi(x))=x )  $$ 

With additional conditions that \(\psi\) and \(\phi\) be continuous.<br>

For example for the circle we might have \( \phi(x,y) = atan2(y,x) , \psi(\theta)= (\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))  \)


<h2>Physics</h2>
There are many Calabi-Yau manifolds that are compatible with string theory. So if the theory is to be more predictive another selection criteria is needed. Perhaps a criteria is to find one which produces a de-Sitter rather than an anti-de-Sitter space.
