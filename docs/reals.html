<h1>Real Numbers</h1>
Real numbers are represented by a limiting series of rational numbers given by a function from the natural numbers to the rationals. A real number can have many series representations just like the rational numbers can. The series \(f(n)\) is such that it must satisfy: \( \forall_{t:\mathbb{N}} \exists_{n:\mathbb{N}} \forall_{m:\mathbb{N}} (m>n) \rightarrow |f(m)-f(n)|\lt\frac{1}{t}  \). We can add, multiply, subtract and divide reals by doing those operations on the Cauchy sequences (subject to some limitations.)
<br>
Note that reals are the "completion" of the rationals and the complex numbers are the "completion" of the complex rationals (using the standard metric).
<br>
Depending on our purposes, we can either work with the real numbers as symbols:
<script>
    createInput("Pi");
    createInput("E");
</script>
Or we can work with their definitions:
<script>
    createInput("Pi.def");
    createInput("E.def");
</script>

To create a  natural number we can write:

<script>
    createInput("Real.Exp(Real.fromRat.def(1))")
</script>



We can multply two real numbers together. We can either keep them in their symbolic form.

<script>
    createInput(
`Real.times(E,Pi)`)
</script>

or we can expand out the definitions:
<script>
    createInput(
`Real.times(E.def,Pi.def)`)
</script>

To get an approximate rational value we can take the 100th term in the series:

<script>
    createInput(`toCauchy(E.def)(100)`)
</script>
<h2>Using derivatives</h2>
<script>
    createInput(`deriv(FUN(Real, x=> x))(Real.fromRat.def(1));
    toCauchy(deriv(FUN(Real, x=>Real.times(x,x)))(Real.fromRat.def(1)))(100)
`)
</script>
