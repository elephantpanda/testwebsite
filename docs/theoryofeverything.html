<h1>Theory Of Everything</h1>
<h2>T.O.E</h2>

The idea here is to formulate a so-called `Theory of Everything'. This must combine quantum theory and general relativity, particle physics and cosmology into one unified self-consistent theory. Most importantly to prove that it gives finite answers in all domains. It must predict all the masses and charges of the particles in the Standard Model.

<h1>Formulating the Question</h1>
The formulating of the theory is difficult because we don't know the exact problem we are trying to solve. We don't know what the degrees of freedom of the Universe are.
